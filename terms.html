      <h2>Section 17 – Entire agreement</h2>
      <p>The failure of us to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</p>
      <p>These Terms of Service and any policies or operating rules posted by us on this site or in respect to The Service constitutes the entire agreement and understanding between you and us and govern your use of the Service, superseding any prior or contemporaneous agreements, communications, and proposals, whether oral or written, between you and us (including, but not limited to, any prior versions of the Terms of Service).</p>
